// The scan engine's downloadable pieces, and the one place that describes them.
//
// Three different things get called "the scan data", they are not
// interchangeable, and the difference decides what a user should press:
//
//   MODELS (cornelius + milo, ~8 MB) — the detector and the embedder. Nothing
//   scans without them, and they are the same two files for every install. NOT in
//   this repository and NOT baked into the container image: the detector is MIT,
//   the embedder is AGPL-3.0-only, and distributing their aggregate requires
//   satisfying both licenses. Fetching them into your own install is your call,
//   which is why this is a button and not a background task.
//
//   PUBLISHED CATALOG (~56 MB) — precomputed embeddings for the whole MTG card
//   pool, published by the model's author. Instant, but a dated snapshot: it is
//   keyed by Scryfall ids rather than this install's card_cache ids, so a hit
//   still has to be mapped back to a card the install knows. It also cannot be
//   updated: a card printed after the snapshot date is simply not in it, and
//   never will be.
//
//   LOCAL BUILDS (catalog.js) — embeddings computed here from card_cache. Slower
//   to create (minutes per set, hours for a whole game) but keyed by card_cache
//   id, so every hit resolves; scopeable to just the sets you own; countable per
//   set, which is what the scan filter's "only sets I can scan" reads; and
//   updatable, so a set released tomorrow is one more short build away.
//
// A local build always wins over a published catalog when both exist — see
// cvScan.hasLocal.
