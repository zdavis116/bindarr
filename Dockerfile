# Card scanning needs a secure context, and a container reached at
# http://<host>:3001 is not one, so TLS is served alongside HTTP. The cert is
# self-signed into /app/database/ssl on first start (persisted with the volume)
# unless SSL_CERT_PATH/SSL_KEY_PATH point at a real one. Set HTTPS_PORT="" to
# serve plain HTTP only.

# Recompile ONLY sqlite3 from source: its node-pre-gyp prebuilt is linked
# against a newer glibc (GLIBC_2.38) than this Debian base provides, so the
# prebuilt aborts at startup with ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED. Building here links against
# the image's own glibc. Scoped to sqlite3 so sharp/onnxruntime-node keep their
# prebuilts (sharp can't build from source without libvips-dev).
